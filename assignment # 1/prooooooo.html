        was an English scientist, architect,
        and<font color="blue">polymath</font> who, using
        a microscope, was the first to visualize a micro-organism.[2]
        An impoverished scientific inquirer in young adulthood, he
        found wealth and esteem by performing over half of the
        architectural surveys after London's
        <font color="blue"> great fire of 1666</font>
        Hooke was also a member of the Royal Society and since
        1662 was its curator of experiments..

        he approximated experimental confirmation that <font color="blue">gravity</font> heeds an<font color="blue">

        furthered and formalised by <font color="blue">Isaac Newton in Newton's law of universal gravitation.

          Robert Hooke: Physics, Architecture, Astronomy, Paleontology, Biology Perhaps one of the greatest
          experimental scientists of the 17th century,
          Robert Hooke of Britain, left an enduring legacy in
          disciplines as diverse as physics,architecture, astronomy, paleontology, and biology. Modern
          microscopes, clocks, and automobiles all bear his imprint, and an important law of elasticity still
          shares his name.</p>

          <strong> Micrographia in earnest after moving to London in 1663.4
            Before getting accommodation in Gresham College in the
            following year, where he would live for the rest of his
            life, he lodged with Katherine Jones, Lady Ranelagh, a
            her house in Pall Mall.5 This was a decade before Robert
            Boyle, Lady Ranelagh's brother,
            asked Hooke to design a laboratory for the house, and at this face"ravie"’Tis not unlikely, but that there
            may be yet invented several other
            helps for the eye, at much exceeding those already found, as those do the bare eye, such as by which we may
            perhaps be able to discover living Creatures in the Moon, or other Planets, the figures of the compounding
            Particles of matter, and the particular Schematisms and Textures of Bodies.17

        He begins a picturesque account of an observation in Micrographia
        with ‘Reading one day in Septemb.’102 We can imagine him, blue
        eyes skimming the lines of a traveller's tale as an autumn morning
        breezes
        through the window of his room in Lady Ranelagh's house.10
